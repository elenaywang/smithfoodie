# What is this project?

Hi! I'm Elena, and I'm currently a senior Computer Science major and Psychology minor at Smith College. I'm really interested in the intersection of technology, psychology, and art, and I'm particularly interested in UI/UX design and human-computer interaction.

The current systems officially employed by Smith are the [official dining menu website](https://www.smith.edu/diningservices/menu_poc/cbord_menus.php) for menus, the [Smith Dining Services website](https://www.smith.edu/your-campus/dining-menus/hours) for operating hours, and [NetNutrition](https://cbweb.smith.edu/NetNutrition/1) for nutritional information.

So this is my attempt at creating a more user-friendly and centralized website for Smith students to check dining menus and hours. And the cool thing is that it's designed for students, by a student! I'm planning to build this website with Ruby on Rails, React, a Microsoft SQL Server database, and Heroku.

I've made a tentative mockup of this project on Figma - you can check it out here: https://www.figma.com/proto/uzgpyqBvM4vdS6XelQkkiV/Smith-College-Foodie-website?node-id=27-30&node-type=canvas&t=xiSaKJH5scltwvZU-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=27%3A30. The UI design of this project takes light inspiration from GrubHub, which Smith officially uses for ordering on-campus food, and other common food delivery apps like Uber Eats.

With this project, I hope to develop a system that future students can continue to build on and further design to be more accessible for the current needs of the student population, as well as spark conversation about how students can be involved in improving the systems used at Smith. I plan to conclude working on this project by the end of the 2024 Fall semester. If you're interested in continuing this project beyond 2024 Fall, please let me know at ewang88@smith.edu!
