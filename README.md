# What is this project?

Hi! I'm Elena, and I graduated from Smith College with a Computer Science major and Psychology minor. I'm really interested in the intersection of technology, psychology, and art, and I'm particularly interested in UI/UX design and human-computer interaction.

When I was still a student, the systems that Smith officially employed were the [official dining menu website](https://www.smith.edu/diningservices/menu_poc/cbord_menus.php) for menus, the [Smith Dining Services website](https://www.smith.edu/your-campus/dining-menus/hours) for operating hours, [NetNutrition](https://cbweb.smith.edu/NetNutrition/1) for nutritional information, and Grubhub for ordering at the cafes.

This project was my attempt at creating a more user-friendly and centralized website for Smith students to check dining information. The idea was that for the selected time or meal, the website will display all of the places on campus where students can get food on campus, along with the corresponding hours, menus, and allergen information. And the cool thing is that it would have been designed for students, by a student! I was planning to build this website with Ruby on Rails, React, a Microsoft SQL Server database, and Heroku.

I made a prototype of this project on Figma - you can check it out here: https://www.figma.com/proto/uzgpyqBvM4vdS6XelQkkiV/Smith-College-Foodie-website?node-id=27-30&node-type=canvas&t=xiSaKJH5scltwvZU-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=27%3A30. The UI design of this project takes light inspiration from GrubHub, which Smith officially used for ordering on-campus food, and other common food delivery apps, like Uber Eats, so that the UI feels familiar and intuitive.

With this project, I was hoping to develop a system that future students can continue to build on and further design to be more accessible for the current needs of the student population, as well as spark conversation about how students can be involved in improving the systems used at Smith.


# Current Status of this Project

I started working on this project during my junior and senior years at Smith as a passion project mostly outside of class. After Fall 2024, I was unable to continue working on this project, so there will no longer be any updates to this project. However, I am keeping this GitHub repo available to archive and document my efforts. 

My work on this project includes:
* connecting with Smith Dining Services and the Office of College Relations' Web Team to gather information about the current system
* creating [my redesign](https://www.figma.com/proto/uzgpyqBvM4vdS6XelQkkiV/Smith-College-Foodie-website?node-id=27-30&node-type=canvas&t=xiSaKJH5scltwvZU-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=27%3A30) of the website in Figma
* assessing the accessibility of my Figma design
   * you can read my documentation in the [**documentation**](https://github.com/elenaywang/smithfoodie/tree/f53bf66095720fc17b4cf877680abea78f836a00/documentation) folder
* gathering student feedback about the official Smith dining menu website and my Figma redesign
   * check out the "Research Problems" section of my [**accessibility report**](https://github.com/elenaywang/smithfoodie/blob/f53bf66095720fc17b4cf877680abea78f836a00/documentation/The%20Accessibility%20of%20Smith%20Foodie%20report.pdf) for feedback on the official Smith dining menu website
   * check out the "Proposed Solutions" section of my [**accessibility report**](https://github.com/elenaywang/smithfoodie/blob/f53bf66095720fc17b4cf877680abea78f836a00/documentation/The%20Accessibility%20of%20Smith%20Foodie%20report.pdf) for feedback on my Figma redesign
* creating this GitHub repo to begin the codebase
* configuring the settings to connect to Smith's official MicrosoftSQL database of dining information

Unfortunately, I did not have time to finish coding the website. However, as the project stands now, it is a solid foundation for the website I envisioned.
